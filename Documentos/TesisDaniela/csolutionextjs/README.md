  cd <ruta de descarga de la imagen de ganache>
  chmod +x ganache-2.5.4-linux-x86_64.AppImage
  ./ganache-2.5.4-linux-x86_64.AppImage
  ```

  In the ganache descktop aplication create new workspace and setect de archive truffle-config.json what was generated when the contract was compiled and start de blockchain
* Windows:

3. Deploy the Smart Contract
   In the terminal put the comand
